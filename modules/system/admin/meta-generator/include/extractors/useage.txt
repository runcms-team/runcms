So how's this work :o)

Any part of the cms can be configured to be extracted by simply dropping
a file named appropriately and with the right filename of its folder.


When the extractor sees a variable like storyid=2 in the url, and is
currently in the /news module directory, it checks to see if a file
called storyid.php is in the extractor extensions folder,
and if it is, it loads the file.

Each file like storyid.php contain 1 simple function get_meta(),
which in turn is just a simple mysql query that returns various
extracted data in whatever way you like.

The function get_meta() gets 2 variables passed:
$id: The reference to the resource (storyid=2, $id=2)
$limit: How deep to dig into the database (is auto-set by Max. Depth)

So now we just build a query and return $meta, which is then processed
normally by the rest of the program.


You actually only change everything between:

$SQL =  "SELECT

<change all this>

return $meta;


Most sections in the cms are already covered for extraction, but if you
wanna extend or personalize some queries, feel free todo so, and if
you come up with something more interesting, send it to me so i can
eventually add it ;-]

You don't have to, but using queries with the join syntax usually
makes it quicker and saves you from doing extra queries to build your
$meta string.

Personally i suck at them too still, so ya might wanna check this page:

Note: You don't have to use JOIN queries, it's just more efficient,
      than doing multiple single queries.
